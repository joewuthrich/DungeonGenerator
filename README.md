# DungeonGenerator
A way to generate random rooms and passageways similar to a roguelike game, and then place those passageways and rooms into Minecraft.


## Room Generation
The rooms and passageways are generated in the following way:
- Get parameters: [number of rooms], [x coordinate center], [z coordinate center], [minimum room edge length], [maximum room edge length]
- Generate [number of rooms] rooms in side a circle
- Space the rooms out until they no longer touch
- Connect each room with a complete graph
- Use a version of Kruskalâ€™s MST Algorithm to generate the optimum connections for the rooms
- Reintroduce a few edges from the complete graph to create cycles
